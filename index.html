    <p2>And Phil Neville has now reacted to his appointment as the new head coach of the England Women's football team.

"This squad's on the verge of something special and I believe I can lead them to the next level," said Neville.

"I am honoured to be given the chance to lead England. With the new coaching team we are putting in place, we can help the players build on their great progress in recent years.

"I can't wait to get out on the training pitch and down to work with an elite group of players at the top of their game.

"There is no greater honour than representing your country and it will be a privilege to do it again."
